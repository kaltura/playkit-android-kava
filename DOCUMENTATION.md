## About Kava:

Kava is abbreviation for Kaltura Advanced Video Analytics. The main purpose of this plugin is to track and collect
various events and data about Playkit video player. Integration is pretty simple and can be achieved during those simple steps.

## Kava Integration:
Kava build on top of Kaltura Playkit SDK so to get started you should add dependencies in your application build.gradle file.
Note, Playkit is already included in KAVAPlugin.

```
dependencies {

    implementation 'com.kaltura:playkit-android-kava:XXX' //instead of XXX use latest version. 
   
}

repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```

Now lets see how to use KAVAPlugin in your application

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        
        //First register your plugin.
        PlayKitManager.registerPlugins(this, KavaAnalyticsPlugin.factory);
        
        //Initialize PKPluginConfigs object.
        PKPluginConfigs pluginConfigs = new PKPluginConfigs();
        
        //Initialize Json object that will hold all the configurations for the plugin.
        JsonObject pluginEntry = new JsonObject();
        
        //Put the partner id.(Mandatory field)
        pluginEntry.addProperty("partnerId", YOUR_PARTNER_ID);
        
        //Set plugin entry to the plugin configs.
        pluginConfigs.setPluginConfig(KavaAnalyticsPlugin.factory.getName(), pluginEntry);

        //Create instance of the player with specified pluginConfigs.
        player = PlayKitManager.loadPlayer(this, pluginConfigs);
    }    
}
```

You can see that start using KAVA is simple and require only few lines of code.


## Plugin configurations:

Like other Kaltura`s Playkit plugins, Kava have a configurations that can be used by application. 
In following code snippet we will see how to configure Kava with custom parameters. Below you will have detailed explanation of each field and it default values.
Note, you can use KavaAnalyticsConfig object or build Json with your configurations. 

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    
    private Player player;
    
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        
        //Create PKPluginConfigs and populate it with Kava plugin configurations.
        PKPluginConfigs pluginConfigs = createPluginConfigurations();
        
        //Create instance of the player with specified pluginConfigs.
        player = PlayKitManager.loadPlayer(this, pluginConfigs);
    }
    
    private PKPluginConfigs createPluginConfigurations() {
    
            //First register your plugin.
            PlayKitManager.registerPlugins(this, KavaAnalyticsPlugin.factory);
    
            //Initialize PKPluginConfigs object.
            PKPluginConfigs pluginConfigs = new PKPluginConfigs();
    
            //Set your configurations.
            KavaAnalyticsConfig kavaConfig = new KavaAnalyticsConfig()
                    .setPartnerId(123456) //Your partnerId. Mandatory field!
                    .setBaseUrl("yourBaseUrl")
                    .setUiConfId(123456)
                    .setKs("your_ks")
                    .setPlaybackContext("yourPlaybackContext")
                    .setReferrer("your_referrer")
                    .setDvrThreshold(1000) //Threshold from the live edge.
                    .setCustomVar1("customVar1")
                    .setCustomVar2("customVar2")
                    .setCustomVar3("customVar3")
                    .setApplicationVersion("applicationVersion")
                    .setPlaylistId("playlistId");
            
    
            //Set Kava configurations to the PKPluginConfig.
            pluginConfigs.setPluginConfig(KavaAnalyticsPlugin.factory.getName(), kavaConfig);
    
            
            return pluginConfigs;
        }
}

```

## KAVA events explanation:


Here we will see some explanation about each event. When does it sent and what parameters it have.


* <a id="viewEvent"></a>VIEW - Collective event that represent report for every 10 seconds of active playback.

    - 30 seconds without VIEW event will reset KAVA session, so all the VIEW [specific parameters](#endSessionResetParams) should be reset also.
    - Server may notify Kava (via response field ["viewEventsEnabled" = false](#serverResponse)) to shut down VIEW events.
When it happens, VIEW events should be blocked from sending until server decides to enable VIEW events again.
